# Protocol Buffer Examples

Lei Mao

## Introduction

Protocol Buffer, also known as Protobuf, is Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. Protocol Buffers Version 3 (Proto3) was released in 2016. However, the official [tutorials](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/cpptutorial) on the Google protobuf website are still for Proto2. The official [samples](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/master/examples) are using Proto3 and CMake, however, its CMake is not standard and many of its macros were not documented on the official CMake website.

In this repository, I re-implemented Google's official Protobuf C++ and Python example using Proto3 and CMake with the best practice. I also put code comments as many as possible to make sure the code is human readable and easy to understand.

## Dependencies

* Google Protocol Buffers 3.21.9
* CMake 3.14.4+

## Usages

### Build Docker Image

```bash
$ docker build -f docker/protobuf.Dockerfile --build-arg PROTOBUF_VERSION=21.9 --build-arg NUM_JOBS=8 --tag protobuf-cmake:21.9 .
```

### Run Docker Container

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/mnt protobuf-cmake:21.9
```

### Build Examples

```bash
$ cmake -B build
$ cmake --build build --config Release --parallel
```

All the executable files would be generated in `build/bin` directory.

### Run Examples

The C++ and Python serialization and deserialization can be used interchangeably (C++ serialization + C++ deserialization, C++ serialization + Python deserialization, Python serialization + Python deserialization, Python serialization + C++ deserialization), as the data formats are all generated from the same `proto` file and they are all the same.
